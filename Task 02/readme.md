# Task 2: Visualizing for Impact 🎯

## 📌 The Why
Raw data is messy. A good data analyst presents their findings in a clean, easy-to-understand **interactive dashboard**.  
This task focuses on communicating insights effectively to a **non-technical audience**.

---

## 📊 Description
We created an **interactive dashboard** using **Plotly** (and optionally Streamlit/Dash) to visualize the key findings from **Task 1 (EDA)**.

Key Features:
- **Top-Selling Products** visualization
- **Sales by Country** analysis
- **Peak Shopping Hours / Days of Week**
- **Interactive Filters** (dropdown menus for countries, products, etc.)
- Clear and visually appealing dashboard design
