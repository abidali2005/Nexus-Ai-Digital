# Task 1: Understanding the Customer’s Story (EDA)

## 📌 Purpose
Understand who GlobalMart’s customers are, how they behave, and what patterns exist in their purchase history. This exploratory work uncovers actionable insights and informs modeling choices for subsequent tasks.

## 🔍 What we looked for
- Customer demographics and distribution (age, region, segment).  
- Purchase behavior: frequency, average order value, lifetime value.  
- Temporal patterns: seasonality, trends, periodic spikes.  
- Product and category performance.  
- Cohorts and retention (how behavior changes with customer age).  
- Data quality issues: missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats.

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Data ingestion & validation** — confirm schema, types, and completeness.  
2. **Cleaning** — unify date formats, fix/cast numeric fields, remove duplicate transactions.  
3. **Univariate analysis** — distributions, outliers, summary statistics for each feature.  
4. **Bivariate analysis** — relationships between features and target behaviors (e.g., churn vs tenure).  
5. **Time-based analysis** — daily/weekly/monthly aggregations to reveal trends and seasonality.  
6. **Cohort & retention analysis** — compute cohorts by acquisition period and track retention/repurchase.  
7. **RFM / value segmentation** — Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis to identify high-value customers.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- A clear narrative (“customer story”) describing segments, high-risk behaviors, and product hotspots.  
- Cleaned dataset and EDA notebook with visualizations and summary tables.  
- Specific hypotheses to test in modeling tasks (e.g., “month-to-month contracts have higher churn”).

## 💡 Business value
Helps marketing and product teams tailor engagement strategies, prioritize segments, and reduce data surprises before modeling.

# Task 2: Visualizing for Impact

## 📌 Purpose
Communicate findings clearly to stakeholders through polished visualizations and dashboards that enable quick, data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 What we focused on
- Clear dashboard layout: KPIs, trend charts, segment breakdowns.  
- Actionable charts (not just pretty ones): cohort retention plots, funnel visualizations, top product lists.  
- Mobile and executive-ready visual assets.

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Select KPIs** — e.g., daily sales, active customers, churn rate, average order value, repeat purchase rate.  
2. **Design wireframes** — arrange visuals by stakeholder needs (executive summary vs. operational detail).  
3. **Build visualizations** — time series, bar charts, heatmaps, cohort charts, distribution violin/box plots.  
4. **Dashboard assembly** — compile visuals into an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau / Plotly Dash).  
5. **Annotation & storytelling** — adding context, short insights, and recommended actions on dashboard panes.  
6. **Export assets** — PNGs for reports and a live dashboard link for daily monitoring.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- Interactive dashboard with a one-page executive view and drill-downs for operations.  
- A set of export-ready charts for presentations and leadership updates.

## 💡 Business value
Enables rapid identification of problems/opportunities (sales drops, rising churn) and supports data-driven meetings.

# Task 3: Predicting Customer Churn (Classification)

## 📌 Purpose
Build a baseline classification model to predict customers likely to churn so the business can intervene proactively.

## 🔍 What we targeted
- Binary prediction: churn (1) vs no-churn (0).  
- Baseline performance and understanding of feature importance.

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Label definition** — define churn (e.g., no purchase in N days after last purchase).  
2. **Feature engineering** — RFM features, tenure, recency, frequency, payment plan, complaints, product categories, promotions interactions.  
3. **Preprocessing** — handle missing values, encode categorical variables, split train/test.  
4. **Model baseline** — Logistic Regression as a simple interpretable baseline.  
5. **Evaluation** — Accuracy, but also confusion matrix to inspect false negatives/positives.  
6. **Interpretation** — coefficient analysis or simple feature importance for business insights.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- A trained logistic regression baseline, evaluation metrics, and list of top features influencing churn.

## 💡 Business value
A working pipeline to flag at-risk customers for targeted retention campaigns; baseline for further improvements (Task 4).

# Task 4: Optimizing Churn Prediction (Advanced Classification)

## 📌 Purpose
Improve the baseline churn model’s performance using more powerful algorithms and robust evaluation so GlobalMart can better prioritize retention actions.

## 🔍 What we targeted
- Higher recall on churners (catch more true churners) while maintaining reasonable precision.  
- Use advanced models and calibration of predicted probabilities for business decisions.

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Feature scaling** — StandardScaler or RobustScaler for numeric inputs where required.  
2. **Modeling** — Train and tune ensemble models like Random Forest and gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost / LightGBM).  
3. **Hyperparameter tuning** — grid search or randomized search with cross-validation (time-aware split if needed).  
4. **Class imbalance handling** — class weights, oversampling (SMOTE), or threshold tuning.  
5. **Advanced evaluation** — Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Precision@K, and business-oriented metrics (cost-based).  
6. **Model comparison** — compare advanced models to logistic baseline and pick the best trade-off for business goals.  
7. **Explainability** — SHAP or feature importance to explain predictions to stakeholders.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- A strong classification model with improved recall/precision trade-off, clear evaluation tables, and explainability reports.  
- Recommendation on model to deploy and its expected business impact.

## 💡 Business value
Better detection of churners leads to more efficient retention spend and higher customer lifetime value.

# Task 5: Building a Product Recommendation System

## 📌 Purpose
Increase average order value and customer engagement by recommending relevant products at the right time.

## 🔍 What we considered
- Use cases: on-site recommendations, email campaign personalization, “customers who bought this also bought...”, and “recommended for you”.  
- Offline evaluation metrics and online validation strategy.

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Data framing** — build a user-item interaction matrix (purchase counts, ratings, or implicit feedback).  
2. **Preprocessing** — filter sparse users/items, create train/test splits (time-based for realistic evaluation).  
3. **Modeling options**:
   - **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: user-based or item-based neighborhood models for simple, interpretable recommendations.  
   - **Matrix Factorization**: SVD / Alternating Least Squares for scalable latent-factor models.  
   - **Content-Based**: use product metadata and customer profiles for cold-start items/users.  
   - **Hybrid**: combine collaborative and content signals.  
4. **Evaluation metrics** — Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, NDCG, and offline A/B testing plan for online validation.  
5. **Cold-start strategy** — content-based fallback, popularity-based recommendations, or onboarding quizzes.  
6. **Deployment considerations** — latency, freshness, and retraining frequency.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- A recommendation engine prototype producing top-K recommendations per user.  
- Offline evaluation report and a plan for A/B testing in production.

## 💡 Business value
Personalized recommendations increase conversions, cross-sell opportunities, and customer retention.

# Task 6: Forecasting Future Sales (Time Series Analysis)

## 📌 Purpose
Provide accurate short-term sales forecasts (e.g., next 30 days) to inform inventory, staffing, and procurement decisions.

## 🔍 What we focused on
- Model types that capture trend and seasonality.  
- Business-ready forecasts with uncertainty estimates (prediction intervals).

## 🛠️ Approach (high-level steps)
1. **Series creation** — aggregate transactional sales to daily/weekly/monthly series depending on noise.  
2. **EDA & decomposition** — visualize trend, seasonal cycle(s), and residuals to choose modeling approach and seasonal period `m`.  
3. **Stationarity & differencing** — test with ADF and perform differencing (regular and seasonal) as needed.  
4. **Model selection** — ARIMA/SARIMA for interpretable seasonal models; ETS/Prophet or ML models for complex patterns.  
5. **Evaluation** — hold out last N days (e.g., 30) for test, evaluate with MAE/RMSE/MAPE, and optionally use walk-forward validation.  
6. **Refinement** — transform data (log) if variance grows with level; consider external regressors (holidays, promotions) with SARIMAX.  
7. **Forecast and uncertainty** — produce point forecasts + 95% prediction intervals.  
8. **Deployment** — schedule retraining frequency, automate forecast export, and build dashboard visualizing history vs forecast.

## ✅ Expected outcome
- A notebook or pipeline producing a 30-day forecast with confidence intervals, performance metrics, and recommended reorder/stocking actions.

## 💡 Business value
More accurate forecasts reduce stockouts and overstock, optimizing working capital and improving service levels.
